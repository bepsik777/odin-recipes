    <h2>Space Cookies</h2>
    <p>
        Here we will cover an easy space cookies recipe. Although it is sweet and may be considered a desert, we sugest you
        eat it before the main dish, as an appetizer. It might help you enjoy the rest of your meal.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup cannabutter </li>
        <li>2/3 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 and 1/3 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 and 1/3 cups of chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Prep time: 1 hour</li>

        <li>Cook time: 12 - 25  minutes</li>
        
        <li>Servings: 10 - 15 cookies</li>
    <ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven 20 minutes at 375°F.</li>
        <li>In one of the large bowls, sift the flour, baking soda, and salt with the indicated measurements 
            and mix them using the whisk or, in case you don’t have one, a fork will do. Set this bowl aside.
        </li>

        <li>With the cannabutter at room temperature, put ½ cup in the other large bowl with the brown and granulated sugar 
            and mix with the hand mixer until they are smooth and creamy.</li>

        <li>Then, add the egg and the two teaspoons of vanilla extract and combine them together using the hand mixer. 
            Stop when you get a uniform mixture.</li>

        <li>Add the chocolate chips and stir with the spatula, distributing them evenly.</li>

        <li>Incorporate the flour prepared at the beginning 
            to the other bowl where the wet ingredients are and use the spatula to form the dough.</li>
        <li>Cover the cookie tray with parchment paper and spray the surface with non/stick
             cooking spray so you can place the dough balls evenly on the tray, leaving space between each ball.</li>

        <li>Depending on how big or small you want your cookies, the baking time varies. For big cookies, you should set 
            the temperature at 375 degrees and leave them for 22 minutes. If the cookies are small, 
            then use the same temperatures but bake for 12 minutes.</li>
            
    </ol>
