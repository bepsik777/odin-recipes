This is my first Odin Project project.

It will demonstrate my newly acquired skills and knowledge about HTML. 
I will make a recipe website, using only HTML. I will use my knowledge of headings, paragraphs, lists, links and images to create that website.
I will also try to commit my project with GIT, to practice my version controll skillset.
